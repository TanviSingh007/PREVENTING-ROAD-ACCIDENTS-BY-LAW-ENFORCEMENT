# सह-TRAVELLER
Many families lose someone very close to some road accidents which are sometimes caused by DROWSINESS (due to tiredness ), NOT wearing SEATBELTS and Sometimes due to some kids(MINOR) or people who are NOT AUTHORISED to drive a car (i.e do NOT have a DRIVING LICENCE) . In order to maintain the drivers safety , and to ensure that proper Road laws are followed , सह-TRAVELLER has been developed that can check seat belt , drowsiness and authenticity of Driver in REAL-TIME that will alert them when they are yawning or feeling sleepy , it will also detect if the driver has worn a seatbelt or not . Any violation of road safety rules like drowsy (yawn + sleep) driving and No seatbelt will result into penalty because when you break the rule your picture will be clicked as a proof . At the same time you should be a registered Driver because , only REGISTERED Drivers are recognized and if you are UNREGISTERED then your picture will be clicked and saved in the folder.
